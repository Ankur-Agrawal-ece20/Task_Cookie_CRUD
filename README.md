- Javascript Cookies are not the best functinality for codes if used natively. It is a bit painful. Why not solve this problem?
- Create Set, Get functions for cookies, so that accessing data via cookies becomes easy.
- Create following functions:
  1. setCookie(key, value)
  2. getCookie(key)
  3. deleteCookie(key)
  4. listCookies()

- Use the boilerplate UI attached in this repo to execute these functions.
